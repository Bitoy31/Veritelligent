I'm trying to build a Multi-player web-app and educational game for my capstone. This app is intended to be use as a tool for a teacher in class. It is meant to be projected in front of the class if you're a teacher, and the student will use their gadget as a medium to participate. So this is needed to be responsive as much as possible for things like if the student is using a phone.

It's more like an entertainment game show but for class activities such as quiz, recitations, groupings and such where the teacher is the host and the student is the players.

This app will only have a fix amount of games. The game will have a two category. Solo and Party, Both category will only have 2 game mode or game types.

The questions, answers, pointing system, and timers in the games are flexible and editable by the teachers.
